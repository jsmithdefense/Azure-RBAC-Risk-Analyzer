## The Problem

Azure environments accumulate RBAC assignments over time. Role names are often 
opaque, assignments are scattered across subscriptions, and no native tooling tells 
you which identities represent the greatest real-world risk — or what to do about it.

Security teams need to know: **who can do what, across which resources, and what 
happens if that access is abused.**

---

## What This Tool Does

The Azure RBAC Risk Analyzer enumerates role assignments across your entire Azure 
tenant, scores each principal by cumulative privilege exposure, generates AI-powered 
capability narratives explaining the real-world impact of each identity's access, 
and offers to execute approved remediations directly against your environment.

**No third-party platforms. No agents. No connectors.** Just the Azure SDK and the 
Anthropic API running against your control plane.

## Who This Is For

| Persona | Use Case |
|---|---|
| Security Engineers | Tenant-wide RBAC risk assessment |
| SOC Analysts | Identity threat investigation |
| Cloud Architects | Privilege accumulation detection |
| Compliance Teams | Audit-ready risk documentation |
| Penetration Testers | Pre-engagement identity reconnaissance |

## Features

**Multi-Subscription Tenant Analysis**
Enumerate all accessible subscriptions, select individual targets or analyze all at 
once. Risk is aggregated at the tenant level with per-subscription ranking.

**Capability-Based Role Classification**
Roles are classified by what their permissions actually allow — not just their names. 
A custom role containing `/action` permissions gets flagged regardless of what it's 
called.

| Classification | What It Means |
|---|---|
| `privilege_escalation` | Can modify access control |
| `resource_control_broad` | Can create or modify infrastructure |
| `resource_control_narrow` | Controls a specific service domain |
| `data_access` | Can read or extract stored data |
| `security_visibility` | Can view monitoring or security telemetry |
| `read_only` | Limited to metadata inspection |

**Cumulative Risk Scoring**
Principal risk is the sum of all assignment scores across all subscriptions — not 
just the single highest role. This surfaces identities that accumulate significant 
privilege through multiple lower-severity assignments.

**Interactive AI Enrichment**
Select which principals to analyze, choose your model, review the estimated cost 
before confirming. Each enriched principal receives:
- Plain-English capability summary explaining operational impact and abuse potential
- Prioritized remediation playbook with Why, Steps, and Validation for each action

**PDF Report Export**
Professional security report suitable for stakeholder review. Includes tenant 
summary, subscription rankings, role classifications, principal risk analysis, and 
the full AI enrichment output with formatted remediation playbooks.

**Remediation Engine**
AI output is parsed into structured, machine-executable actions. Each action is 
presented for individual approval, logged to an audit file before execution, 
executed via the Azure SDK, and validated.

| Action Type | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `remove_role_assignment` | Executes removal via Azure SDK, validates success |
| `convert_to_pim_eligible` | Provides step-by-step PIM instructions |
| `manual_review_required` | Logs description for human execution |

## Sample Output

### Principal Risk Analysis
```
Name = analysts (500 members) | Type = Group | Severity = Critical | Score = 475
  - Medium | 55 | Microsoft Sentinel Responder | resource_control_broad | production-soc-rg
  - Medium | 40 | Alert Rules Admin            | resource_control_narrow | production-soc-rg
  - Medium | 40 | Student NSG User             | resource_control_narrow | network-controls-rg
  - Low    | 30 | Student Subnet Joiner        | resource_control_narrow | core-vnet
```

### AI Capability Summary
```
- The analysts group can create, modify, and delete Sentinel alert rules via the 
  Alert Rules Admin role — meaning they could disable or weaken detection logic 
  within the SOC workspace, directly undermining the integrity of monitoring.

- The combination of alert rule write access and Sentinel Responder permissions 
  creates a realistic defense evasion path: group members could disable detections, 
  suppress active incidents, and cover their tracks — all within their assigned roles.
```

### Remediation Playbook
```
[CRITICAL | Effort: Low] Remove Alert Rules Admin from analysts group

Why
Group members with write access to Sentinel analytics rules can disable detections
that the SOC depends on to monitor the environment.

Steps
  1. Navigate to Azure Portal → production-soc-rg → Access control (IAM)
  2. Filter Role assignments by the analysts group
  3. Locate Alert Rules Admin → Remove → Confirm

Validation
az role assignment list --assignee <group-id> --resource-group production-soc-rg
Confirm no Alert Rules Admin entry is returned.
```

### Remediation Engine
```
REMEDIATION ENGINE
============================================================
  Principal: analysts (Group)
